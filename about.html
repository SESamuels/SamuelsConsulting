<p class=headline_c>About Samuels Consulting</p>
<p class=blue2>Samuels Consulting differs from large consulting firms by offering:</p>
<ul class=bullet><li>Less impact on your business with one external person interacting with your staff</li>
<li>One knowledgeable point of contact for project questions, updates and results</li>
<li>Speed of execution</li>
<li>Flexibility in project timing and scope to meet your business needs</li>
<li>Customized project approach based on your urgency and business needs</li>
</ul>
<p class=blue2>How Samuels Consulting began:</p>
<p class=about>In 2009 Stew was approached by a former colleague to help her company review and analyze their business processes and management systems to determine the underlying causes of a severe billing backlog</p>
<p class=about> Stew walked through each step of the company's product delivery and billing processes and provided the CEO with the requested detailed analysis and specific recommendations to address the causes of the backlog.</p>
<p class=about>A by-product of this experience was that Stew discovered how much he really enjoyed this role - utilizing his broad business experience and knowledge of where and how problems could occur and how to successfully address these problems.</p>
